    Parse a PDF content stream into a sequence of instructions.

    A PDF content stream is list of instructions that describe where to render
    the text and graphics in a PDF. This is the starting point for analyzing
    PDFs.

    If the input is a page and page.Contents is an array, then the content
    stream is automatically treated as one coalesced stream.

    Each instruction contains at least one operator and zero or more operands.

    This function does not have anything to do with opening a PDF file itself or
    processing data from a whole PDF. It is for processing a specific object inside
    a PDF that is already opened.

    Args:
        page_or_stream: A page object, or the content
            stream attached to another object such as a Form XObject.
        operators: A space-separated string of operators to whitelist.
            For example 'q Q cm Do' will return only operators
            that pertain to drawing images. Use 'BI ID EI' for inline images.
            All other operators and associated tokens are ignored. If blank,
            all tokens are accepted.

    Returns:
        list: List of ``(operands, command)`` tuples where ``command`` is an
            operator (str) and ``operands`` is a tuple of str; the PDF drawing
            command and the command's operands, respectively.

    Example:

        >>> pdf = pikepdf.Pdf.open(input_pdf)
        >>> page = pdf.pages[0]
        >>> for operands, command in parse_content_stream(page):
        >>>     print(command)
