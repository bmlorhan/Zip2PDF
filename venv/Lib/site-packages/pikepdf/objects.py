"""Provide classes to stand in for PDF objects

The purpose of these is to provide nice-looking classes to allow explicit
construction of PDF objects and more pythonic idioms and facilitate discovery
by documentation generators and linters.

It's also a place to narrow the scope of input types to those more easily
converted to C++.

There is some deliberate "smoke and mirrors" here: all of the objects are truly
instances of ``pikepdf.Object``, which is a variant container object. The
``__new__`` constructs a ``pikepdf.Object`` in each case, and the rest of the
class definition is present as an aide for code introspection.
